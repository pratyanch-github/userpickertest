# Specifications
=> When you click on the input field, a list of items will appear.

=> As you type, the list should show only items that match what you're typing.

=> Clicking on an item should turn it into a chip at the top, and the input field should adjust automatically.

=> Once an item becomes a chip, it should no longer be in the list.

=> Each chip has an "X" icon. Clicking it removes the chip and adds the item back to the list.
